Astro is a modern web framework built for content-heavy sites that need strong performance without giving up developer ergonomics.

## Why Astro?

In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, choosing the right framework can make or break your project. Astro stands out for several compelling reasons:

1. **Performance First** — Ship less JavaScript and keep the default runtime light
2. **Content Focused** — A strong fit for blogs, docs, landing pages, and design-heavy sites
3. **Flexible** — Use Astro components first, and add React, Vue, Svelte, or other UI islands only where they help
4. **Composable Rendering** — Mix static pages, content collections, and server routes when the project actually needs them

> The best code is no code at all. Astro embraces this philosophy by minimizing client-side JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Start by creating a new Astro project:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-project
cd my-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the project is running, Astro gives you a fast baseline: file-based routing, `.astro` components, Markdown support, and a production build that stays close to the shape of your content.

## Project Structure

A typical content-focused Astro project might look like this:

```
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── blog/
│   │       └── hello-world.md
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── BaseLayout.astro
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── index.astro
│   │   └── api/
│   │       └── health.json.ts
│   └── styles/
│       └── global.css
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/content.config.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
└── package.json
```

## Creating Components

Astro components use the `.astro` extension and let you keep data loading, markup, and component-scoped styles in one file:

```astro
---
// Component script
const { title, description } = Astro.props;
const publishDate = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
  dateStyle: 'long'
}).format(new Date());
---

<article class="card">
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <p>{description}</p>
  <time>{publishDate}</time>
</article>

<style>
  .card {
    padding: 1.5rem;
    border-radius: 8px;
    background: #f5f5f4;
  }
</style>
```

## Why The Baseline Feels Fast

Astro's default model is simple:

- static HTML is generated ahead of time when possible
- client-side JavaScript is opt-in instead of automatic
- content and route structure stay close to the filesystem
- interactive widgets can be isolated instead of turning the whole page into an app shell

## Key Features

### Content Collections

Content Collections provide type-safe content management and work especially well for blogs, docs, changelogs, and internal knowledge bases:

```typescript
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { glob } from 'astro/loaders';
import { z } from 'astro/zod';

const posts = defineCollection({
  loader: glob({ pattern: '**/*.md', base: './src/content/posts' }),
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string().optional(),
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
    draft: z.boolean().default(false),
  }),
});

export const collections = { posts };
```

### Server Routes When You Need Them

Astro can stay fully static, but you can also add server routes for read-only JSON, form handling, or authenticated actions when the deployment target supports them:

```typescript
// src/pages/api/health.json.ts
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';

export const GET: APIRoute = () => {
  return new Response(
    JSON.stringify({ ok: true, updatedAt: new Date().toISOString() }),
    {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
      }
    }
  );
};
```

## Deployment

For a content-focused site, the default deployment loop is still pleasantly small:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If the site is mostly static, you can ship the generated output to any static host. If you need on-demand server logic, Astro also supports adapter-based deployment targets.

The important part is to choose the smallest runtime that still matches the problem you're solving.

## Conclusion

Astro works best when you want a site to feel fast, stay maintainable, and let content drive the structure. Whether you're building a personal blog, a product handbook, or a theme demo, it gives you a clean baseline and enough escape hatches for the parts that genuinely need more power.
